# Countries
This app is made with react.js,html and css.

1. In app.js, we retrieve data from api and store it in an array called contacts. This is done with the help of {useState}.
2. Contacts is passed to another component called Contacts.
3. In this file, we create an input whereby user will enter name of the country. An eventlistener is added to preventdefault and get value input by the user.
4. We use this value to filter the name of the countries and display the name of universities in that particular country.
5. We convert value input by user tolowerstring so as to prevent error and ambiguity.
